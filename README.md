miscellaneous python files used in my Chemical Engineer Master Thesis (TFM)

My master thesis consist on intermolecular potentials parameter estimation for water + n-alkanes and electrolytes solutions using SAFT-y Mie Equation of Estate. 
Those files were used to validate different paramter estimation with experimental data extracted from literature and recorded in excel files. 
Different quantitive metrics and visual graphs were plotted in order to assess different models.
